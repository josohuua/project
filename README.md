What does this code do?
This JavaScript code creates an array of numbers, doubles each value in the array, and logs the new array to the console.

How do I run this code?
To run this code, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Node.js website.

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you've saved this code.
Type node index.js and press enter.
The doubled array should be logged to the console.
Can I modify this code?
Yes, you can modify this code to create different arrays or perform different operations on the array. For example, you could try:

Squaring each value in the array instead of doubling it
Adding 1 to each value in the array
Creating a new array that only contains the even values from the original array
Feel free to experiment with the code and see what you can come up with!
